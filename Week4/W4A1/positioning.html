        We've been studying player ranks and ranked matchmaking all-up extremely closely since launch and we are excited to be rolling out updates next week.

        <h3>CANON FODDER: SHIPPIN' OUT</h3>
        <h6>2/2/2022</h6>
        Don't you always find that January feels like something of a malaise, like some kind of stopgap purgatory, before you realize we truly are into the new year? We all have our 'pick me ups,' and if you're here then I would assume it's the promise of new Halo lore that gets the gears turning and reignites the synapses.
