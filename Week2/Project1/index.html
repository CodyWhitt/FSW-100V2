        <H3> We Live in a Greenhouse</H3>

        <p>Life on Eath depends on energy coming from the Sum. About half the light reaching the Earth's atmosphere pass through the air and clouds to the surface, where it is absorbed and then radiated upward in the for of infrared head. About <b>90 Percent</b> of
        this is then absorbed by the greenhouse gases and radiated back toward the surface.</p>

        <p>Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the expansion of the "greenhouse effect" â€” warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat radiating from the Earth toward space.</p>

        <p>Gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping. Long-lived gases that remain semi-perminantly in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or chemically to the changes in tempurature are described as "forcing" climate change. 
        Gases, such as water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to the changes in tempurature are seen as "feedbacks".</p>

        <p>Gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect include:</p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Nitrous Oxide</li>
        <li>Carbon Dioxide</li>
        <li>Methane</li>
        <li>Water Vapor</li>
        </ol>
