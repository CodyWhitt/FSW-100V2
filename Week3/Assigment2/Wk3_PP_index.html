            <h1>SERVER -> CLIENT DESYNCHRONIZATION</h1>
            <h3>THE ISSUE</h3>
            <p>Players have found cases where you can permanently desync the client from the server. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/halo/comments/r78moa/halo_infinite_has_a_major_desync_problem_which_is/">This thread on the Halo subreddit</a> is a good example of these cases. 
            Usually, the moment we detect a desync, no matter how small, the client should begin correcting to the server's position. In bad cases this results in rubberbanding, but in normal scenarios these changes should be unnoticeable. 
            The cases where you permanently desync occur when our systems fail to detect and respond to desyncs.
            </p>
            <h3>MITIGATION</h3>
            <p>We have identified the issue linked above, along with some other cases where you can permanently desync, and we should have the fix deployed in upcoming builds. Keep an eye on the patch notes for more info.
